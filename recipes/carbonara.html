    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Colloquially known as "Coal Miners" pasta, this basic dish is delicious and easy</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g pasta (any similar to spaghetti will work)</li>
        <li>100g Guanciale (Bacon or Pancetta wil also work well)</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>100g parmesean cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cooking the pasta</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, cook the guanciale in a pan.  Once crispy, turn pan off to let cool.</li>
        <li>Add parmesean, salt & pepper, 1 whole egg, and 1 egg yolk to a mixing bowl.  Mix well until the mixture has a creamy consistency</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is done, add it to the guanciale.  Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the egg/paremsean mixture.  Add slowly while mixing.  We do not want the heat of the pasta or pan to scramble the egg but instead turn it into a custardy sauce</li>
        <li>Serve in a bowl.  Free to top with more cheese.</li>
    </ol>
